## Hi there 👋

🌟 Welcome to my GitHub Profile! 🌟

👋 Hello, fellow explorer of data and culinary delights! I'm Pallavi Hunswadkar🌸, currently a graduate student pursuing my Masters in Business Analytics. With 6 years of experience as a Quality Analyst, I bring a keen eye for detail to this captivating adventure. ✨

🍁 I believe in embracing the wonders of life, finding inspiration in the little things, and always seeking opportunities to grow and learn.

💡 When I'm not unraveling the mysteries of data, you'll find me diving into the celestial realm of astrology or whipping up culinary masterpieces in the kitchen. Exploring the cosmic wonders and blending ingredients to create culinary magic both ignite my soul. 🌌🍳

📚 Alongside my literary escapades, I find solace in the warmth of my family's embrace, cherishing the love and support they bring to my life. 💖

🐶 Fun fact about me: My heart brims with love not just for dogs, but also for our feline companions. Stray dogs and cats hold a special place in my heart, and I dedicate my free time to feeding and caring for them. I find immense joy in nourishing the souls of stray dogs and cats in my neighborhood, ensuring they feel loved and cared for. Their wagging tails and gentle purrs brighten my days and remind me of the power of compassion. 🐾❤️

🌟 May our data insights sparkle, the celestial knowledge guide us, the flavors mesmerize our senses, and the love we share with our Family, Friends and our furry buddies illuminate our path! 🌟
